                  I reached out to Paragon for my cousins wedding night celebrations, 
                  she was quite keen to get a good mix of Indian and English music to 
                  keep the crowd engaged. They were SO EASY to book with and so friendly 
                  throughout the entire process, any vision she had they carried forward 
                  through their graphic designs and visuals. The stage and the entire setup 
                  on the night was divine, they really went above and beyond. DJ MB smacked 
                  every single mix, I cannot stress enough how good they made the night - 
                  we received endless compliments! They were extremely genuine and guided 
                  us through the entire process, anything we were unsure about they provided 
                  us with their industry knowledge to create a memorable night. We were in 
                  contact with MB from start to finish he really did take care of us. 
                  Can not recommend the Paragon team enough!
